# Design Skills for Claude Code

A collection of UX and design skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). These skills give Claude deep knowledge of established design frameworks, heuristics, and methodologies — turning it into an informed design partner rather than a generic assistant.

Each skill follows the same architecture: a main `SKILL.md` file that works standalone, plus `references/`, `templates/`, and `examples/` directories that provide depth on demand.

## Skills

### UX Research
Plan, conduct, and analyze user research using proven methodologies.

Covers generative, evaluative, and continuous discovery research. Includes interview scripting, usability test planning, participant recruiting, qualitative analysis (affinity diagrams, thematic analysis), and synthesis into personas, journey maps, and opportunity maps.

**Key references:** 20+ research methods catalog, interviewing techniques, usability testing with SUS scoring (full 10-question scale, scoring formula, grade interpretation), workshop facilitation methods (HMW, Creative Matrix, Dot Voting, and 12 more), continuous discovery (Opportunity Solution Trees, assumption testing).

### Design Critique & Evaluation
Evaluate UI designs against usability heuristics, UX laws, interaction patterns, and interaction design principles.

Provides a structured 7-step critique framework grounded in Nielsen's 10 heuristics, 27 UX laws organized by design domain, established usability checks, and interaction design principles (product posture, perpetual intermediates, excise audits, orchestration).

**Key references:** 50+ interaction patterns catalog with use/don't-use guidance, heuristics and laws deep reference, visual design principles (hierarchy, typography, color, spacing), interaction design principles.

### Accessibility Audit
Conduct accessibility audits against WCAG 2.2 guidelines.

A 5-layer audit process (automated, keyboard, screen reader, visual, flow) covering conformance at A, AA, and AAA levels. Identifies issues, assesses severity, provides code fixes, and generates audit reports.

**Key references:** Complete WCAG 2.2 checklist reorganized into 11 audit task groups, 15 common issues with before/after code examples, testing tools comparison (axe, WAVE, Lighthouse, Pa11y), CI/CD integration code, keyboard and screen reader test scripts.

### Journey Mapping
Create customer journey maps, service blueprints, experience maps, empathy maps, and other alignment diagrams.

Guides diagram type selection across 7 diagram types, content structure, illustration syntax, and alignment workshops. Based on established alignment diagram methodology and service design practice.

**Key references:** Customer journey maps (8 required + 7 optional elements), service blueprints (5 swimlanes, 3 lines), experience maps and mental models, alignment workshop facilitation (half-day and full-day formats).

### Design Systems
Build, document, and maintain design systems with design tokens, component specifications, pattern libraries, naming conventions, and governance processes.

Covers the full lifecycle of design systems — from interface inventory and consolidation through token architecture, component hierarchy, pattern documentation, and long-term governance. Grounded in Atomic Design methodology, pattern-driven approaches, and real-world systems.

**Key references:** Component hierarchy (atoms through pages), 3-tier design token architecture with W3C format, pattern documentation standards, governance models (centralized/federated/hybrid), perceptual patterns (color systems, typography scales, spacing, motion, voice & tone), system maturity model (5 levels).

### UX Strategy
Connect design decisions to business outcomes through competitive analysis, opportunity mapping, Jobs to Be Done, outcome-driven discovery, and UX metrics.

Covers the full strategy process — from framing business context through customer discovery, competitive positioning, value proposition design, hypothesis-driven validation, and outcome measurement. Integrates Opportunity Solution Trees, JTBD job mapping, HEART framework, and Lean UX principles.

**Key references:** Outcomes and continuous discovery (OSTs, product trio, interview cadence), competitive analysis (matrix, value innovation, four actions framework, market positioning), Jobs to Be Done (job mapping, desired outcomes, four forces of switching, JTBD personas), metrics (HEART, North Star, funnel metrics, instrumentation), value proposition design (validation hierarchy, Lean UX loop, MVP strategy, business model alignment).

### Design Elevation
Transform functional visual outputs into polished, professional designs.

Applies systematic design thinking to any visual output — presentations, spreadsheets, dashboards, reports, HTML, PDFs, web pages, and data visualizations. References best practices from Stripe, Linear, Apple, Bauhaus, and Swiss design.

**Key references:** Typography scales, color systems, spacing systems, grid systems, design interrogation protocol, technique catalog, design exemplars.

## Installation

### Install all skills

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/cuellarfr/design-skills.git

# Copy all skills to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r design-skills/*/ ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Install a single skill

```bash
# Example: install only the design critique skill
cp -r design-skills/design-critique ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Verify installation

Skills are automatically detected by Claude Code. After copying, start a new conversation and the skills will appear in the available skills list. You can verify by asking Claude:

```

## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file (200-350 lines)
│                          # Standalone — works without reference files
│                          # Contains frameworks, tables, checklists, quick references
│
├── references/            # Deep reference material (loaded on demand)
│   ├── topic-a.md         # Detailed coverage of a specific area
│   └── topic-b.md         # Each file is self-contained

    ├── walkthrough.md      # Full worked example with fictional product
    └── scenarios.md        # Decision scenarios with rationale
```

**Design principles for these skills:**
- **Opinionated defaults** — Specific numbers, benchmarks, and rubrics rather than "consider..." language
- **Actionable over theoretical** — Every principle includes a concrete recommendation
- **Before/after examples** — Show what bad and good look like, with scoring
- **Progressive depth** — Main file is comprehensive standalone; reference files go deeper
- **Grounded in sources** — Built from established books and frameworks, not invented heuristics
