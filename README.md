# Design Skills for Claude Code

A collection of UX and design skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/). These skills give your AI coding tool deep knowledge of established design frameworks, heuristics, and methodologies — turning it into an informed design partner rather than a generic assistant.

Each skill follows the same architecture: a main `SKILL.md` file that works standalone, plus `references/`, `templates/`, and `examples/` directories that provide depth on demand.

## Skills

**Design principles for these skills:**
- **Opinionated defaults** — Specific numbers, benchmarks, and rubrics rather than "consider..." language
- **Actionable over theoretical** — Every principle includes a concrete recommendation
- **Before/after examples** — Show what bad and good look like, with scoring
- **Progressive depth** — Main file is comprehensive standalone; reference files go deeper
- **Grounded in sources** — Built from established books and frameworks, not invented heuristics
