# Design Skills for Claude Code

A collection of UX and design skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/). These skills give your AI coding tool deep knowledge of established design frameworks, heuristics, and methodologies — turning it into an informed design partner rather than a generic assistant.

Each skill follows the same architecture: a main `SKILL.md` file that works standalone, plus `references/`, `templates/`, and `examples/` directories that provide depth on demand.

## Skills

### Design Ops & Handoff
Run design sprints, manage design-to-development handoff, establish team rituals, documentation standards, and design QA processes.

Covers the operational side of design — how teams organize work, collaborate with engineering, and ship quality. From 5-day design sprints through handoff specs, critique facilitation, documentation standards, visual QA processes, and scaled-down methods for lean teams. Grounded in Knapp's Sprint methodology, Buley's UX team-of-one framework, and real-world design ops practice.

## Skill Architecture

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file (200-350 lines)
│                          # Standalone — works without reference files
│                          # Contains frameworks, tables, checklists, quick references
│
├── references/            # Deep reference material (loaded on demand)
│   ├── topic-a.md         # Detailed coverage of a specific area
│   └── topic-b.md         # Each file is self-contained
│
├── templates/             # Fillable templates for deliverables

    ├── walkthrough.md      # Full worked example with fictional product
    └── scenarios.md        # Decision scenarios with rationale
```

**Design principles for these skills:**
- **Opinionated defaults** — Specific numbers, benchmarks, and rubrics rather than "consider..." language
- **Actionable over theoretical** — Every principle includes a concrete recommendation
- **Before/after examples** — Show what bad and good look like, with scoring
- **Progressive depth** — Main file is comprehensive standalone; reference files go deeper
- **Grounded in sources** — Built from established books and frameworks, not invented heuristics
