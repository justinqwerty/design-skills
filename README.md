# Design Skills for Claude Code

A collection of UX and design skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). These skills give Claude deep knowledge of established design frameworks, heuristics, and methodologies — turning it into an informed design partner rather than a generic assistant.

Each skill follows the same architecture: a main `SKILL.md` file that works standalone, plus `references/`, `templates/`, and `examples/` directories that provide depth on demand.

## Skills

### UX Research
Plan, conduct, and analyze user research using proven methodologies.

Covers generative, evaluative, and continuous discovery research. Includes interview scripting, usability test planning, participant recruiting, qualitative analysis (affinity diagrams, thematic analysis), and synthesis into personas, journey maps, and opportunity maps.

**Key references:** 20+ research methods catalog, interviewing techniques, usability testing with SUS scoring (full 10-question scale, scoring formula, grade interpretation), workshop facilitation methods (HMW, Creative Matrix, Dot Voting, and 12 more), continuous discovery (Opportunity Solution Trees, assumption testing).

### Interaction Design

### Design Ops & Handoff
Run design sprints, manage design-to-development handoff, establish team rituals, documentation standards, and design QA processes.

Covers the operational side of design — how teams organize work, collaborate with engineering, and ship quality. From 5-day design sprints through handoff specs, critique facilitation, documentation standards, and visual QA processes. Grounded in Knapp's Sprint methodology and real-world design ops practice.

**Key references:** Design sprints (5-day structure, team roles, remote/mini variations, post-sprint actions), handoff process (maturity levels, complete handoff checklist, annotation standards, spec formats, conflict resolution), team rituals (critique, design-eng sync, design review, retro, cadence planning), documentation standards (file organization, naming conventions, versioning, decision records), design QA (detailed checklist, severity scale, issue filing, acceptance criteria, automated visual regression).

### Design Elevation
Transform functional visual outputs into polished, professional designs.

Applies systematic design thinking to any visual output — presentations, spreadsheets, dashboards, reports, HTML, PDFs, web pages, and data visualizations. References best practices from Stripe, Linear, Apple, Bauhaus, and Swiss design.

**Key references:** Typography scales, color systems, spacing systems, grid systems, design interrogation protocol, technique catalog, design exemplars.

**Design principles for these skills:**
- **Opinionated defaults** — Specific numbers, benchmarks, and rubrics rather than "consider..." language
- **Actionable over theoretical** — Every principle includes a concrete recommendation
- **Before/after examples** — Show what bad and good look like, with scoring
- **Progressive depth** — Main file is comprehensive standalone; reference files go deeper
- **Grounded in sources** — Built from established books and frameworks, not invented heuristics
